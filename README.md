# word puzzle game
This is a small word puzzle game that presents to the user a mangled word and asks her to enter the correct, unmangled word. 

If the word to unmangle is pizza the application may present the word as `zpaiz` and the user must then enter `PIZZA` in this order for the solution to be accepted.

### Quick start

```bash
$ npm install

$ npm start
```

go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.


`npm start` will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build, and reload the page.

For production build run:
```bash
$ npm run build
```
